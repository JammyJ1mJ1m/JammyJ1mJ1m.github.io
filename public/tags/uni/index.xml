&lt;h4 id=&#34;game-brief&#34;&gt;Game brief:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 teams consisting of 3 players. One player will take on the driver role who is responsible for driving the tank across the terrain. Another player will take the engineer role who is responsible for keeping the tanks energy systems topped up so that the tank as a whole can operate. The final player has the gunner role, which arguably is the most fun. The gunner is able to move the gun left, right, up and down to its set limits as well as to fire the gun itself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Reason and technologies used Language Technologies C# A* Completed as the final assignment for my Game AI module in second year.
The project has a bot (green circle) and a goal(red circle), the bot will calculate an A* route from bot position to goal position on the 2D grid.
The blue patch is the closed path and the green area open path. Finally the red line is the path the bot has taken</description>
