This module is aimed at introducing students to the "real" world of software development. As such I am in a team working with a real world client to deliver a piece of software.  
In this case my team and I are using agile and prince2 principles to develop an offshore wind turbine virtual reality training software.  
Specifically with a focus on safety training, before, during and transitioning from the crew transfer vehicle(CTV) onto the wind turbine.  
Daily tasks for this include standup meetings and working through the current sprint tasks.
