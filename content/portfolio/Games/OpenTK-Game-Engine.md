A custom game engine being written in C# and OpenTK.  
The engine initially started as part of first semester in my third year(september 2022), I worked on this fairly   regularly until around august 2023. The main technologies used are C# and OpenTk which is an OpenGl framework.  
A finished game can be seen here:
