# A*

#### Reason and technologies used
Completed as the final assignment for my Game AI module in second year.

Language used is C#. 

The project has a bot (green circle) and a goal(red circle), the bot will calculate an A* route from bot position to goal position on the 2D grid.

The blue patch is the closed path and the green area open path. Finally the red line is the path the bot has taken
