# VeRy Troublesome tanks

#### Reason and technologies used
This project was the final software piece that went alongside my dissertation.  
The game is a VR port of the original game called: [Troublesome tanks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GafLNMRZxGI).
The idea was to provide a more immersive and fun take on the original game.
