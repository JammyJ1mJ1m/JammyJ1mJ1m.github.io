# Brief
Computer graphics gallery consisting of 4 rooms each with a different exhibit  

* Each room is to contain an exhibit that demonstrates one or more of the shading, animation and lighting effects listed below. Advanced effects (see below for a full description) are marked with a (*)

* The exhibits can consist of one or more 3D objects.

* The specific 3D objects that make up the exhibit are not defined, although they should be different in every room, and selected to clearly enhance the chosen shading, lighting, animation effects.

* At least one of the 3D objects should consist of a high definition mesh containing 1000's of polygons and be irregular (e.g. teapot, dragon, etc)

* At least one of the exhibits should consist of 1000's of dynamic 3D objects (e.g. a stream of spheres appearing in the ceiling and falling to the floor)

* At least one of the exhibits should consist of multiple dynamic 3D objects where the various animation effects can be demonstrated
